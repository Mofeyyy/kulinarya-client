# Kulinarya 🍲  
**Your Digital Guide for Filipino Gastronomy and Dishes**

Kulinarya is a full-stack web application created as a capstone project by two BSIT students from Colegio de San Gabriel Arcangel. The platform allows users to browse, post, and interact with Filipino recipes from different provinces in the Philippines.  

This project was built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with secure authentication, media uploading, and role-based access.

> 🔒 This repository highlights my main role in the backend and partial frontend integration.
